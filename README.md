# Generators-for-all
This project involves creating a website that generates motivational quotations, breaking news, and programming jokes. 
It also has a function that allows users to share these contents on prominent social networking networks like WhatsApp, LinkedIn, and Twitter. 
This website is mobile and desktop responsive, which means it will look fantastic on any device and provide a good user experience.
